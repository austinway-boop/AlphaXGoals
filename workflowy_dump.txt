Shielding teens from social friction is the BIGGEST mistake parents make.
Letting AI choose your friends will make your life MORE enjoyable than if you were to choose them yourself.
Every team needs an argumentative devil's advocate that the rest of the team can't stand.
Parents should give kids unrestricted access to age-appropriate online spaces.
Traditional Team-building exercises are useless. Teams should be playing video games to get to know each other, not doing trust falls.

Spikey POV Myth 1
Category 1: Dopamine. Specifically in the context of gaming.  
Summary: This section will inform about what Dopamine is, why it is important in gaming, how it occors in gaming, how to harness it effectively.

1. Dopamine is a chemical released in your brain when you experience something rewarding. This means that when you receive a reward in the game you most likely will receive a release of dopamine. Think of dopamine as the addictive drug that makes you keep playing. This is why progression systems work.

Summary: 
Link:
1. Dopamine happens in real life, from eating, exercising, and MOST importantly social connection. 
2. Dopamine can occur in gaming, it is most commonly shown to occur when the player is anticipating or receiving a reward. But it can also occur when social interaction occurs. (AKA my algorithm selling point)

Summary:
Link:
1. Your brain can distinguish between different types of dopamine. Meaning if you receive a reward your brain would know it was dopamine caused by the reward. If you receive dopamine for social interaction your brain would know. 
2. What is more crazy than the above is that dopamine goes to different places. Dopamine earned from a reward can travel different neural pathways than dopamine earned through social interaction. 
3. That is insane. You can build a tolerance to reward-based dopamine and social dopamine separately. This again is insane. That means that if you only offer reward-based dopamine in the beginning, then switch to social dopamine you could completely remove the tolerance to the reward-based dopamine and then just swap it back. This is the solution to games getting boring.  (In theory)
To explain a bit more: We have 2 types of dopamine, first (food/survival related) and secondary (social interaction) to that end, they can be distinguished. 
(In theory)

Social dopamine can be released from positive social interactions such as your friend praising you. It can also be released in anticipation of good social interaction, and from positive person interactions such as garnering likes on youtube. 
1. Current matchmaking systems have it all wrong. The initial action of playing a video game generates enough dopamine that it is unnecessary to give them the perfect match, at least right away. Instead, if these systems prioritized quality over speed it would make the player enjoy the game over a longer period of time. That is because we as humans can become accustomed to the dopamine release that games provide making it less effective at keeping us addicted. (It's similar to how you can build up a drug tolerance.) By gradually increasing the quality of the social connection you can effectively generate more engagement. 
2. Social Interaction is more addicting than Rewards / The anticipation of rewards. Social interaction releases a more volatile flow of dopamine creating a similar dopamine release to social media. Your brain makes you continue to attempt to recreate reactions that generate large amounts of dopamine. This makes you want to keep going back to have the social interaction as much as you can and, at some point, if you have the same dopamine reaction you will just want more.
